# FitnessApp
Application created in Android Studio. It serves as an organiser for people attending to gym, which includes features such as: creating your own training plans, adding your own exercises, mapping specific plans with a day of week, displaying calendar with training type planned for a specific day. I was a member of a two-person team. I was responsible mostly for backend.
